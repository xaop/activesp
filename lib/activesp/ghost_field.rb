  # This class represents the field definitions for objects in SharePoint for which the
  # fields cannot be changed and are thus not represented by an object in SharePoint.
  # These include fields of sites, lists, users, grouos, roles, content types and fields.
  # The interface of this class is not as complete as the interface if a Field, mainly
  # because it does not make much sense to do so
